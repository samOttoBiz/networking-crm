Build a simple Networking CRM app with two main pages:

Add Contact Page

Fields:

Name (required)

Email (optional)

Company Name (optional)

Notes (optional)

Next Follow-Up Date (optional)

Auto-generate:

timestamp (record when submitted)

last_connected (default to the same as timestamp, but editable later)

Submit button → saves the new contact into Supabase.

Manage Contacts Page

Display a list of all contacts from Supabase.

If no contacts exist, show the message: “No existing contacts”.

Each contact should be clickable to open an Edit Contact Page, where I can:

Edit any of the fields (Name, Email, Company, Notes, Next Follow-Up, Last Connected).

Save changes back to Supabase.

Requirements:

App should be connected to Supabase for storage.

Allow integration with n8n webhook for automations (later I will provide the webhook URL).

Connect to GitHub so I can version control this project.

UI should be clean and simple, with clear navigation between “Add Contact” and “Manage Contacts.”
